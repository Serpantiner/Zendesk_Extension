Extention that me and my colleague have created in order to improve some of the Zendesk functionality.

https://youtu.be/PI4qzZWDUXk (Video of how it works)

Functionality:

Press the Icon of the extension and navigate from there ->
Start the ticket preview is responsible for providing you with the preview of the tct, you can use it on any que you like. (Example - Critical. Press the button and it will begin the process, every processed tct will be highlighted in yellow.
Stop button will terminate the process, and it will no longer process tcts preview.
Please note that the information processed by the Start the ticket preview will not be saved when you move to a different que due to Zendesk policy and general HIPAA confidentiality, so make sure that you just open the different que like Messages, Normal in a new tab.
Start the ticket preview can be ran only on 1 que (meaning it can process tct preview only from 1 que simultaneously, do not attempt to run it at the same time in 2 different ques)  untill there are no more tcts to preview/or it is stopped.
Check for white Spaces will check new FC DC/old DC for any white spaces that you may have (except the greetings) and will highlight red if it needs attention.
Regular functionality for filling out new FC DC/old DC with checkboxes works as intended.
Right click for openings tcts in a new tab is enabled by default, it can be turned off by clicking the button (Right Click Enabled)
If you exeprience issues, reload the browser/page or close it/reopen.


There are also more functions, but here is the general scoop of how it works.
